This is the first post on my blog — **a small kickoff** for everything I want to build here.  
I’ll be sharing **longer design projects**, **case studies**, **experiments with automation and AI**, and thoughts on how to make digital work **more efficient and enjoyable**.

Over the years I’ve moved from pure graphic design into **UX/UI**, **optimisation**, **RPA**, and **smarter workflows**. This space will help me **document that journey**, **organise what I learn**, and hopefully create something **useful for others** too.

More **posts**, **projects** and **ideas** are on the way.
