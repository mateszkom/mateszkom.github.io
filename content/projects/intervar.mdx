## The project

### Intervar - Your personal workout interval assistant

**Intervar is a mobile app designed to assist with workouts.** \
Users create custom interval workouts: what to do, when to rest, and when to start. You can also browse and reuse routines shared by others. The app is for anyone who wants to stay healthy and be more productive during training.\
**Role:** UX/UI Designer, UX Researcher\
**Methods:** Research, Competitive Audit, User Personas, Wireframing\
**Prototyping Tools:** Figma, FigJam

## Empathize

I started with a competitive audit (SWOT) and a feature analysis of existing interval apps. Then I reviewed user opinions to learn motivations and pain points.

Summary of findings: the UI should be balanced, neither too simple nor too complex. The app should be accessible without requiring an account. It should also include a community library of plans that users can filter and rate.

## User personas

The target audience is people interested in fitness and exercise. This includes beginners who need help getting started and experienced athletes looking to be more productive during workouts.
Demographically, the audience includes men and women around 20-40. I created two personas that match these user groups.

Next, I created user stories to capture needs and goals. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who wants it.

During ideation, I sketched early concepts, defined the feature set, and mapped the user flow. I also built wireframes to visualize the final product.

Next, I created a simple prototype based on the user flows and wireframes.

I then built a small design system (type, icons, buttons, colors) and used it to complete the key flow screens.
