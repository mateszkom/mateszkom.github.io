#####  About me

##### Hello, I’m Mateusz. Currently, #pI work as an e-commerce graphic designer at the Polish company LPP S.A. My responsibilities include creating promotional materials for various online channels, social media, as well as designing graphics for websites and mobile applications.\
\
I’ve been interested in UX/UI for several years, starting around
2018-19. I’m creating this website to document my journey in this field,
showcase my work, and perhaps share some aspects of my personal life. \
\
I plan to write text tutorials, possibly building my own knowledge base on UX for both myself and others.\
